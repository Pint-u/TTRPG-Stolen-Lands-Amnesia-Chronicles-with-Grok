- **man**: Displays this command list. Description: "Quick reference for all commands."
- **debug [feature]**: Tests game elements without advancing state. Examples: "debug roll d20 +5" (simulates roll), "debug feat add Carpentry to Glenn" (tests Character_Sheets update, revert after). Description: "For testing rolls, feats, or updates—use code_execution if needed."
